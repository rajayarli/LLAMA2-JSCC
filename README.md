# LLAMA2-JSCC: Semantic Communication with Llama-2 over Joint Source Channel Coding

We develop and evaluate an innovative approach by integrating Llama-2, an advanced language model, into the Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) framework for semantic communication (SemCom) networking. Addressing the need for sophisticated SemCom data networking systems, our novel solution significantly improves data transport efficiency with semantic accuracy, filling a gap often overlooked in existing JSCC approaches. Through empirical evaluations and simulations, we demonstrate notable improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of SemCom compared to existing solutions. This work contributes to the field, offering a scalable and efficient SemCom framework that aligns with impeding objectives and sets the stage for future innovations in semantic data networking.
